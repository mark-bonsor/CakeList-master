# CakeList-master

Mark Bonsor

Completed Cake List technical test for Waracle


The tableView now loads correctly, with a new placeholder 'cake' 'image filling in for the images as they download asynchronously from the web. Images are cached to ensure that repeated images are only downloaded once.

I have applied some basic formatting to the text data to ensure that titles and sentences start with capital letter.

Given more time, I would further separate out the retrieval and handling of the network data from the rest of the table data class.
